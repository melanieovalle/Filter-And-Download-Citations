# Interlibrary Loan Citation Filter & Export

This tool is designed specifically for the “Finished Requests” history page of the Bowdoin College Interlibrary Loan (ILL) website. It allows users to filter requests by specific criteria and quickly export citation data.

Users can choose from three filtering options: 
- **Manually Select**
- **Select All**
- **Select by Year** (based on the availability of years in thhe ILL system).

Once applied, the script gathers the matching requests, retrieves the relevant metadata, and formats it for easy export. 
Citations can be downloaded in either .bib or .pdf format. 
- **.bib files** can be imported into Zotero, EndNote, or any other citation management tool.
- **.pdf files** are formatted following APA guidelines.
** Currently, the **.pdf** file option is only formatting English Language characters. For foreign language citations, we recommend the **.bib** option.
