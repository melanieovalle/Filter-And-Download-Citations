# Interlibrary Loan Citation Filter & Export

This tool is designed specifically for the “Finished Requests” history page, 
where users can filter requests by certain criteria and quickly export citation data.

Once a filter ('Manually Select', 'Select All', or 'Select by Year') is applied, the script selects the matching requests, retrieves the relevant metadata, and formats it for easy use. 
The citations can then be downloaded in either .bib or .pdf format (that follows APA guidelines). Users can import .bib files into Zotero or EndNote (or any other citation management tool).
